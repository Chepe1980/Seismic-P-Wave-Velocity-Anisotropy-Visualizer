# Seismic-P-Wave-Velocity-Anisotropy-Visualizer
This script visualizes how seismic P-wave velocity varies with direction (anisotropy) due to:      epsilon: Controls the "stretch" of the velocity ellipse along the X-axis.      delta: Affects the curvature near the axes.      gamma: Defined but unused (likely a placeholder for shear-wave anisotropy).
